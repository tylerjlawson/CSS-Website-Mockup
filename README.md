# CSS-Website-Mockup

I took a screen shot of the desktop screen for desktop.png

I took a screen shot of tablet and mobile by opening the chrome inspector using the device toolbar, then hit the  3 dots in the upper right(More Options), hit show device frame, then hit more options again and hit the capture screenshot button

There is a demo at http://tyler-lawson.com/#projects
